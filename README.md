A new representation of Yelp bookmarks to fill feature gaps in the standard Yelp bookmark experience. Yelp Combinator uses a combination of page scraping, the Yelp Fusion API, and mapping platforms to collect, display, search, and filter your bookmarked businesses in a more useful and beautiful way.

## 🔄 Backend API

This frontend connects to a [separate backend service](https://github.com/louismcohen/yelp-combinator-backend-ts) that handles:

- Yelp API integration
- Data storage and caching
- Business updates and synchronization
- Semantic search capabilities

By default, it connects to the production API, but you can point it to a local backend by updating the `VITE_BACKEND_API_URL` in your `.env` file.
